## Advanced git Techniques

This lesson covers advanced topics in git, using GitHub and RStudio. 
Topics include forks, issues, pull requests, branches, and creating user and project GitHub Pages.

## Instructor Notes

This lesson is intended to pick up where the [basic git lesson](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/basic-git-lesson) 
and [git in the shell lesson](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/git-in-the-shell-lesson) leave off.

We taught this lesson as part of the "postdoc data science whirlwind" day on 7 Oct 2020.
Here are a few additional notes from that day that future instructors should be aware of:

- The lesson was taught by showing everything from the RStudio server interface and using the Terminal
tab within RStudio. This confused some students who were more used to just opening a terminal window
locally, or possibly doing it within JupyterLab. So just be aware to make sure people who might not
be using RStudio are following along.
- On the other side of the coin, some students weren't too familiar with the RStudio GUI. Make sure
you don't assume they all are, and accommodate those who are not.
- When creating a new empty repo on GitHub, you need to have at least one commit before you can
create a branch. Otherwise there is no master/main branch and thus nothing to branch a new branch from.
Initializing the repo with a README.md will accomplish this.
- Though the students did review the prerequisite material, many of them did not already have their own
git workflow set up either locally or on the SESYNC server, so it's important to make sure that everyone
sets up a repo to be used for this lesson.
- The amount of content is probably adequate for a 2-3 hour time block without covering any of the 
material on GitHub Pages. We may split that into a separate lesson in the future.
