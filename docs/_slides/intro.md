It is incomplete and still in development. Please check back later. Thank you for your patience.

## Lesson Objectives

- Build on the techniques learned in the basic git lesson with more advanced topics
- Learn how to use git and GitHub to work with collaborators inside and outside your immediate research group
- Publicize your work with GitHub Pages

===

## Specific Achievements

- Create a branch and merge it back into the primary branch
- Fork a repository
- Make pull requests and accept others' pull requests
- Use GitHub Issues to track your work
- Create and edit GitHub Pages for your user account and for one of your projects

## Why do I care?

The basic git lesson gives you most of what you need to work on your own or with occasional help from a collaborator. If you are
interested in building your git skills to deal with more complicated workflows, this lesson is intended for you!

Before you continue, it's important to note that a lot of these procedures are more widely used for software development than
for research purposes. In software (or website) development, you have to be very careful about making unnecessary changes that
might break the code and render everything useless. However, if you are doing exploratory statistical analysis or visualization,
there is usually no harm in adding extra scripts to a repository or tacking on a few more lines to make another figure or data
summary. Because individual data analysis scripts are usually fairly self-contained, even if you make mistakes, it is almost
impossible to "break" other code in the project. So, if most of what you do is data analysis and you aren't really programming,
some of the advanced topics we're going to cover might be a little overkill for you. 95% of what you need to do in the typical
research workflow can be accomplished with stage, commit, push, pull, and the occasional resolving of a merge conflict.

With all of that said, though, even if you rarely or never use some of these techniques, it is helpful just to be exposed to
them and know the lingo. You may run across these terms being used and it is good to have some idea of what's going on.
