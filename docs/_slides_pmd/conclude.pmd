## Additional resources

The material in this lesson is partly based on 
[Data Carpentry: Python for Ecologists](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/) and the 
[Data Carpentry for Biologists](http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/) course. 
These are good resources for a more detailed overview of data analysis and scientific computing in Python.
