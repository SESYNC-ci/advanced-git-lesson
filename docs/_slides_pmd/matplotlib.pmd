## Matplotlib

The **matplotlib** package and its **pyplot** module is the workhorse for all
Python vizualizations. Many objects have their own methods to create
plots using **matplotlib**, including Pandas DataFrames.

The **pyplot** module controls the creation, management and export of plots produced
by other objects or by direct calls to the family of `pyplot.plot()` functions.

===

The DataFrame `plot()` method creates a scatterplot, here for the `weight` versus the `hindfoot_length` for records in the `surveys_dm` data.

```{python scatter, term=False}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
ax = surveys_dm.plot('hindfoot_length', 'weight', kind = 'scatter')
```

The `ax` object holds the plot description, and depending on the IDE and operating system the plot may or may not appear. If it does not,  the `plt.show()` function displays the active figure on screen.

Besides `scatter`, the `plot` method supports other kinds of plots such
as bar and line graphs. To create the histogram of one variable from the data
frame, you may use a different method, `hist`.

```{python hist, term=False}
ax = surveys_dm.hist('weight')
plt.savefig('hist_weight.pdf')
```
