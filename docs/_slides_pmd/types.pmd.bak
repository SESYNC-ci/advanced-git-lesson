## Data types

The immutable data types are

| `'int'`   | Integer          |
| `'float'` | Real number      |
| `'str'`   | Character string |
| `'bool'`  | `True`/`False`   |
| `'tuple'` | Sequence         |

Any object can be queried with `type()` 

```{python}
t = ('x', 3, True)
```
```{python}
type(t)
```

Python supports the usual arithmetic operators for numeric types:

| `+`  | addition                |
| `-`  | subtraction             |
| `*`  | multiplication          |
| `/`  | floating-point division |
| `**` | exponent                |
| `%`  | modulus                 |
| `//` | floor division          |

===

Some operators have natural extensions to non-numeric types:

```{python}
a * 2
```

```{python}
t + tuple(3.14)
```

===

Comparison operators are symbols or plain english:

| `==`       | equal                             |
| `!=`       | non-equal                         |
| `>`, `<`   | greater, lesser                   |
| `>=`, `<=` | greater or equal, lesser or equal |
| `and`      | logical and                       |
| `or`       | logical or                        |
| `not`      | logical negation                  |
| `in`       | logical membership                |

## Exercise 1

Explore the use of `in` to test membership. What can an object of type `'int'` be a member of? Is it the same for an object of type `'str'`?
