## Forks

... insert a goofy picture of a fork here ...

In git parlance, a *fork* is similar to a clone in that you are making a copy of a repo. But in contrast to a clone, the expectation is that your repo will diverge in its history from the original, ultimately becoming its own project.

If you fork a repo, it is probably going to be one where you aren't collaborating directly with its creator. The creator may continue to make updates, adding commits to their version's history, while you do the same. A good example would be if you are making a GitHub Page, and you want to use a premade template. Many page templates have their own repos that you can fork and create your own page from. The content you add to the page will make it its own project, and obviously you would not ever want to incorporate the content you added back into the original template.
