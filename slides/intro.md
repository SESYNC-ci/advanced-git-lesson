## Lesson Objectives

**This lesson is in [pre-alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Pre-alpha) status!**
It is incomplete and still in development. Please check back later. Thank you for your patience.
{:.notes}

- Build on the techniques learned in the basic git lesson with more advanced topics
- Use git and GitHub to work with collaborators inside and outside your immediate research group
- Publicize your work with GitHub Pages

===

## Specific Achievements

- Create, modify, and merge branches to reduce conflict within your project and with collaborators
- Fork a repository to add your own contributions to someone else's project
- Make and accept pull requests for smooth and respectful collaboration
- Use GitHub Issues to document and manage your work
- Create and edit GitHub Pages for your user account and for one of your projects

===

## Prerequisites

You should be able to do the basic git actions described in the 
[Basic git Lesson](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/basic-git-lesson) 
or the [Git in the Shell lesson](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/git-in-the-shell-lesson):
set up a repo, stage changes, commit, push, and pull.

## Why do I care?

The basic git lesson gives you most of what you need to work on your own or with occasional help from a collaborator. If you are
interested in building your git skills to deal with more complicated workflows, this lesson is intended for you!

Before you continue, it's important to note that a lot of these procedures are more widely used for software development than
for research purposes. In software (or website) development, you have to be very careful about making unnecessary changes that
might "break" the code and render everything useless. 
However, if you are doing exploratory statistical analysis or visualization,
there is usually no harm in adding extra scripts to a repository or tacking on a few more lines to make another figure or data
summary. Because individual data analysis scripts are usually fairly self-contained, even if you make mistakes, you rarely break other code in the project. 95% of what you need to do in the typical
research workflow can be accomplished with stage, commit, push, pull, and the occasional resolving of a merge conflict.

With all of that said, though, even if you rarely or never use some of these techniques, it is helpful just to be exposed to
them and know the lingo. You may run across these terms being used and it is good to have some idea of what's going on.
