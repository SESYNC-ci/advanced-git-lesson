## GitHub Issues

Issues are a useful feature of GitHub.com. The user interface is fairly easy to figure out so I will not spend a lot of time explaining how to use it. Instead I will highlight a few ways to improve your workflow using issues.

===

### Uses for Issues

- Pointing out a bug or feature request in someone else's repository
- Making a to-do list for yourself
- Maintaining a record of rich information about your work

===

You can reference users, commits, pull requests, and other issues in the text of your issue, and they will automatically be linked.

To reference users, use the `@` sign followed by their name.

To reference commits, use the first 7 digits of the commit's hash (it will look something like `5d1001b`).

To reference pull requests and other issues, use the `#` sign followed by the number ID of the pull request or issue. They go up sequentially starting at `#1`.

Again, issues are not difficult to use. This is just a plug to encourage everyone to make them a part of their workflow!
