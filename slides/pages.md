## GitHub Pages

GitHub provides free* web hosting through GitHub Pages. You can create a site associated with your user account (`{{ site.data.lesson.example.user }}.github.io`) or a page for any of your repos (`mycoolproject.github.io`). 

\* = Because GitHub is owned by Microsoft it is not guaranteed that any of the services they provide will be free forever. It is for now.

### How does it work?

===

### Creating a user page

In this example, we will create a page associated with your user account by forking a pre-made template.

The [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) is probably the most widely used free template. Consider donating to the developer on PayPal.

===

Go to the repo page for Minimal Mistakes on GitHub.com and fork the repo into your account.
