## Pull Requests

A **pull request** (PR for short) is just what it says it is: a *request* that the owner of a repo 
*pull* your changes, incorporating them into his or her repo. 

===

For this part of the lesson, there are two roles, the **Owner** and **Collaborator**. Find a partner, 
and go through this exercise twice, each time taking a different role. 

The **Collaborator** will make the PR and the **Owner** will modify, then accept it.

===

**Collaborator**: Go to the "Pull Requests" tab in the xxx repository. You should see something like this.

... insert image of PR here ...

===

**Collaborator**: Specify that you want to compare the xxx branch of your forked repository 
with the master branch of the current repository.

===

That's it, you've just made a pull request!

You have made a request for the **Owner** of the repo to review the commits you've made to the code, 
in the hope that he or she will accept the request and add your changes to the primary official version of the repo.

===

**Owner**: As the owner, you will receive an email saying that someone has made a pull request on your repo. 
Your options are:

- Accept the pull request as is
- Make additional changes to the pull request and then accept
- Decline the pull request

===

**Owner**: In this example, let's say you wanted to accept the pull request, but you need to make some additional
changes to the code before merging it with your primary branch.

To add commits on top of a pull request, you need to pull the branch created by the PR to your local repo.

Do this by xxx.

===

**Owner**: Add something to the code, maybe just a comment or two. 

Stage, commit, and push --- but make sure you are pushing to the PR branch!

===

**Owner**: Go back to GitHub.com and view the PR page. You should see your additional commits there.

Accept the pull request!

===

**Owner**: Now the commits made by your collaborator, and the modifications you made on top of them, are both part of 
the primary branch of the repo. 

Pull these changes to your local repo.

===

**Collaborator**: Now that the owner has merged your PR with the primary branch on his or her repo,
you can pull and check out that primary branch. You can continue to periodically pull the owner's
new commits to your local repo.

===

Halftime! Switch sides!

Trade places with your partner and repeat the exercise.
